											<h1>About Me</h1>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-wilson-b8809742/">My Linken Page</a>
<h2> Hi my name is Anna Wilson. I was born in Russia and came to USA 12 years
ago. Now I live in New Jersey and for past 6 years worked at  the hospital in
NYC but recently accepted job in NJ. I love to travel and have 11 months old
dauther. </h2>
<h1> Education <h2>
<h2> I graduated from NJIT 7 years ago with BS in Information Technology-
Medical Informatics option. About 4 years ago I decided to persue my Master
degree in Business Managment and Information Technology so it's been a slow
process for me. I also tool a break with pregnancy  but
now I want to prove my daughter  that enything is possible if you put your mind
into it and got back on track with my education. After this semestr I will have
only
2 classes left so I'm hoping to graduate next year.</h2>
<h1> Experience </h1>
<h2> I took HTML class as undegraduate student  but it was a long time ago so I
would say I know the basics so will need to study hard for this course. </h2>
